TetherX - Tethering Solution for stock iOS

I wrote TetherX as an alternative for my already existing cydia
tweak which natively enables the tethering feature in the Settings App.

Since the tweak only works with a jailbroken device running Subtrate
(or Substitute if using Electra Jailbreak) I had to modify it and
wrap the exploit in an enclosed package. All builds will be located in
the "Releases" folder. I recommend sticking to the .ipa's in the "StableBuilds" folder,
the ones in "TestBuilds" are just where i have XCode send the initial builds and are likely
unstable.

Installing:
Just download the .ipa file from the "StableBuilds" under "Releases" and sideload with
Cydia Impactor. Official site & downloads @ http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/
