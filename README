    TetherX - Tethering Solution for Stock iOS
--------------------------------------------------



I wrote TetherX as an alternative for my already existing cydia tweak
which natively enables the tethering feature in the Settings App.

Since the tweak only works with a jailbroken device running Subtrate
(or Substitute if using Electra Jailbreak) I had to modify it and
wrap the exploit in an sandboxed app package. All builds will be located in
the "IPA's" folder. I recommend only downloading/installing builds in 
the "StableBuilds" folder. Those located in "TestBuilds" are likely unstable
and will probably require a Developer AppleID to work properly.

Installing:
Just download the .ipa file from the "StableBuilds" under "IPA's" and sideload with
Cydia Impactor. Official site & downloads @ http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/

Soon I plan on pre-signing all of the app packages so you can just download directly
on your iDevice with a link I will provide when it's ready.
